- Positive values indicate profitable trades relative to your risk target

### Risk Deviation
- Shows how much your actual risk differs from your ideal risk
- Formula: `((Actual Risk - Ideal Risk) / Ideal Risk) × 100`
- Helps identify over-risked and under-risked positions

### Sharpe Ratio
- Risk-adjusted return measure
- Higher values indicate better risk-adjusted performance
- Calculated using Expected R values

### Maximum Drawdown
